# SRVE - Crypto for the People
SRVE is an open-source cryptocurrency exchange powered by LOTS of exchanges! Learn how we work below!

## How it works
SRVE uses other (no KYC/instant/DEX) exchange's APIs to preform requests on your behalf for privacy or ease-of-use purposes. Here's how a transaction works!

You go to SRVE and input an amount -> We return a recieve price for your pair -> You accept the offer -> We use FixedFloat's API (for now) to get a trade ready for you -> We display the amounts and addresses -> We keep you posted along the way about the status of your trade!

And it's all baked into a clean UI free from distractions and ads! We're commission free (except for partner exchange fees), and (of course) totally free to use, with no sign up required!
